              What is PCOS Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS, also known as PCOD)
              is a medical condition that causes hormonal imbalance in women.
              PCOS or PCOD will make your body secrete more male hormones
              (androgen) than usual. This excess secretion will enlarge your
              ovaries, making you develop small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the
              outer edges of your ovaries and, you will experience
              irregularities in your menstrual cycles and infertility. PCOS
              affects women during their childbearing years, which is
              approximately between 12 to 45 years. Studies show that around
              26.7% of women in this age group have PCOS, so if you fall under
              this age group, keep reading. If you are above 45 years of age or
              transitioning into menopause, this would still be relevant, as
              PCOS doesn't go away when menstruation does. [READ MORE: DOES PCOS
              GO AWAY AFTER MENOPAUSE?] Even before getting an ultrasound or
              pelvic exam, you can detect PCOS through its symptoms like
              irregular periods and excessive body hair. You must identify these
              symptoms early on and start your treatment towards the reversal of
              PCOS because, at a later stage, PCOS can contribute to long-term
              health problems such as type 2 diabetes, heart-related diseases,
              and uterine cancer. [READ MORE: DOES PCOS GETS WORSE WITH AGE?]
              What causes PCOS? The precise cause for PCOS remains unknown but
              Doctors say that there are a few factors that can lead you to
              develop PCOS. Insulin resistance – Insulin resistance is a
              condition where your cells stop responding to Insulin. When this
              happens, your body stops converting food into energy and, your
              Pancreas will start to produce an excess amount of Insulin. This
              will result in increase of Androgen levels and will cause
              complications in your menstrual cycle. Heredity – Research
              suggests that certain genes might be linked to PCOS and, you can
              inherit it from your female family members. High level of
              inflammation – Inflammation is a process by which your White blood
              cells fights against diseases. A high level of inflammation
              stimulates the creation of cysts in your ovaries and leads to the
              development of PCOS [READ MORE: WHAT IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF PCOS?]
              How do you know if you have PCOS? PCOS manifests itself through
              syndromes or groups of symptoms in your body. You obviously cannot
              do an ultrasound or a pelvic exam at home but there are other ways
              through which you can initially self-diagnose PCOS. The more
              visible and easily detectable symptoms of PCOS are: ➢ Irregular
              menstrual cycle ➢ Infertility ➢ Excess growth of facial hair and
              hair loss ➢ Weight gain [READ MORE: WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF
              PCOS?] Do you have an irregular menstrual cycle due to PCOS? The
              increase in Androgen levels and the formation of cysts at the
              entrance of your ovaries contribute to the irregularities in your
              menstrual cycle. Your period might be either too short or too long
              with an excessive amount of bleeding. In some cases, you might
              have less than 8 periods per year. [READ MORE: WHAT DOES YOUR
              PERIOD TELL ABOUT PCOS?] Are PCOS and complications in getting
              pregnant linked? The cysts formed in your ovaries will obstruct
              the development and release of eggs. This will result in the
              production of unhealthy eggs, hindering the seamless release of
              eggs from your ovaries. These factors disrupt the fertilization of
              your egg by a sperm and will result in infertility and
              miscarriage. [READ MORE: 18. PCOS AND PREGNANCY – CAN YOU GET
              PREGNANT IF YOU HAVE PCOS?] Can PCOS cause excessive facial hair
              and hair loss? PCOS stimulates your hair follicles and makes you
              develop a male pattern of hair growth. You might notice denser and
              darker hair growth in places like, • Upper lip • Neck • Chest •
              Lower abdomen In addition, you will have higher hair loss in your
              scalp than usual (more than 100 – 250 strands per day) [READ MORE:

              PCOS lead to obesity? When you have PCOS, your body converts food
              into fat and so, you will start to gain weight over time. You
              might notice more weight gain in your abdomen than in other parts
              of the body. [READ MORE IN DOES PCOS GIVE YOU A BIG BELLY?] Why
              should you worry about PCOS? The hormone imbalance caused due to
              PCOS will affect tissues throughout your body and you have a
              higher chance of developing the following serious health
              conditions. Type 2 Diabetes – With PCOS, you will have decreased
              sensitivity to insulin and you will have a higher risk of getting
              type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome – PCOS can lead to a group of
              conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar level,
              low good cholesterol, and high bad cholesterol. All of these
              conditions together will increase the risk of cardiovascular
              disease and stroke. Endometrial cancer – During your periods, the
              lining in your uterus sheds but PCOS messes with your ovulation
              and the lining starts to build up. This thickened uterine lining
              will cause Endometrial/Uterine cancer. Non-alcoholic fatty liver
              disease – The increase of fat due to insulin resistance will lead
              to the accumulation of fat in your liver, which can cause serious
              damage to your liver. Can you reverse PCOS? The good news is YES!
              By modifying certain aspects of your lifestyle, you can balance

              What are the Symptoms of PCOS Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is
              a condition that affects hormone levels in women. If you are a
              woman between 12 years to 45 years, you should know how to
              identify this issue and know when to consult with your physician.
              So, here’s a list of symptoms of PCOS: • Irregular menstrual cycle
              • Infertility • Excess growth of facial hair and hair loss •
              Weight gain • Acne • Skin darkening • Anxiety How is your
              menstrual cycle affected by PCOS? With PCOS, your menstrual cycle
              goes for a toss. Your periods could be irregular, either too short
              or too long! In some cases, you could have an excessive amount of
              bleeding too. When you have PCOS, you tend to have higher androgen
              levels (male hormones) and, an excessive amount of insulin in your
              body. This imbalance creates small cysts in the entrance of your
              ovaries and causes irregularities in your menstrual cycle. [READ

              know when you have irregular periods due to PCOS? • In the case of
              adolescents, you will experience a delay in getting your first
              period • For adults, you will have less than 8 periods in a year •
              The duration between your periods will be less than 21days • The
              period bleeding could end in less than 2 days. • Extended period
              bleeding for more than 5 days. If you identify with any of these
              issues, there is a high chance that you might have PCOS, so we
              suggest you consult with your physician. [READ MORE: WHAT DOES
              YOUR PERIOD TELL ABOUT PCOS] Does PCOS make it harder to get
              pregnant? PCOS is known to cause fertility issues in women.
              According to experts, almost 35% of cases of infertility are due
              to PCOS. Causes of infertility (Shady Groove Fertility, 2008) If
              you have PCOS, the hormonal imbalance interferes with the
              development and release of eggs from your ovaries. It also creates
              multiple fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in your ovaries, hindering your
              ovulation process and affects the quality of your egg. If your
              ovaries do not release a healthy egg, you will experience
              infertility and miscarriage. If this sounds like what you have
              been going through, you might want to consult a doctor. In the
              meantime, keep in mind that PCOS is reversible and, help and
              guidance are available to keep your PCOS symptoms in control!
              [READ MORE: IS IT HARD TO BE PREGNANT IF YOU HAVE PCOS?] Does PCOS
              cause excessive facial hair and hair loss? PCOS causes an excess
              of Androgen, the male hormone which, stimulates your hair
              follicles and causes you to develop a male pattern of hair growth.
              You might notice hair growing in places like, • Upper lip • Chin •
              Neck • Chest • Lower abdomen This excess hair growth will be
              thicker and darker than your usual body hairs. If you notice this
              unusual hair growth, see them as a sign to consult a doctor. Also,
              you may have seen excessive amounts of hair loss in your scalp
              (more than 100 -150 strands.) [READ MORE: PCOS AND FACIAL HAIR:
              HOW TO MANAGE PCOS FACIAL HAIR GROWTH?] Does PCOS cause weight
              gain in the abdominal region? When you have PCOS, insulin
              resistance develops, wherein your body won’t use the insulin
              present in your body. This causes a fluctuation in your Blood
              sugar level and, you become obese. Insulin resistance cycle
              Furthermore, your body secretes extra insulin, which increases the
              male hormones (Androgen) production in your ovaries, and might
              gain more fat in your abdominal area (men usually carry weight in
              that area.) Researchers have found that around 85% of women with
              PCOS suffer from insulin resistance. The more weight you gain, the
              more your other symptoms will start to develop at a quicker pace.

              Acne? PCOS attacks your Pituitary gland, which is responsible for
              the regulation of hormones. This hormonal imbalance causes acne in
              your face, chest, and upper back. Acne is one of the earliest
              symptoms of PCOS and, if you do not exercise caution, it could
              lead to the progress of PCOS and increase of other PCOS symptoms
              in your body. [READ MORE: PCOS AND ACNE: HOW DO I MANAGE MY PCOS
              ACNE?] Is your skin unusually dark in certain areas because of
              PCOS? When you have PCOS, you are prone to develop discoloration
              (scientifically called Acanthosis nigricans) in certain parts of
              your skin. Insulin resistance causes your skin to have patches of
              black and purplish velvet textures in your underarm region and
              under your breasts too. The same colour and texture will also form
              a ring around your neck. No skin treatment can get rid of this
              discoloration, and only by addressing the underlying insulin
              resistance issue can this be reversed. Does PCOS make you more
              anxious? Anxiety is one of the psychological symptoms of PCOS.
              Hormonal changes coupled with sudden weight gain and excessive
              hair growth in the “unfeminine” places in your body can cause
              emotional and mental stress lowering your self-esteem and can have
              a significant impact on your overall mood. Studies show that women
              with PCOS are 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety
              than women without PCOS. [READ MORE: PCOS AND MENTAL HEALTH: HOW

                worldwide don't know the precise cause of PCOS? Most believe
                that several factors such as insulin resistance, hormonal

              What is the main cause of PCOS Do you know that Researchers,
              doctors, and health care providers worldwide don't know the
              precise cause of PCOS? Most believe that several factors such as
              insulin resistance, hormonal changes, genetics, inflammation,
              lifestyle changes, and environmental factors cause PCOS. How does
              Insulin Resistance Cause PCOS? Insulin resistance is caused
              majorly by lifestyle factors. As more blood sugar enters the
              bloodstream, the pancreas secretes more insulin to push the blood
              sugar into the cells. Over time, your cells stop responding to all
              that insulin. This condition is insulin resistance. A higher level
              of insulin increases the production of androgens (a group of
              hormones that play a role in male traits), causing difficulty with
              ovulation. Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance. Insulin
              resistance leads to weight gain, irregular periods, and even type
              2 diabetes if left unchecked. How do Hormonal Changes Cause PCOS?
              Due to hormonal imbalance, there will be an increase in male
              hormone production (hyperandrogenism). Androgens are called the
              “male hormones”, which control the development of male traits in
              your body. The ovaries produce high levels of androgens (such as
              testosterone). Higher than the normal androgen levels in your body
              can affect your ovaries and prevent ovulation and thus, remain a
              leading cause of infertility. The hormonal imbalance also
              contributes to symptoms, such as irregular periods, male pattern
              baldness, excess hair growth, and acne. Apart from Androgens,
              imbalance in hormones such as estrogen, cortisol, thyroid hormone
              can also cause PCOS. Is PCOS Genetic? Scientists believe that
              there is a link between certain genes and PCOS and that the link
              is likely to be complex and involves multiple genes. A wide
              variety of genes and mechanisms seem to cause PCOS and, so it has
              a wide range of symptoms and develops at different ages for women.
              Genes trigger a hormone cascade in your body which affects hormone
              levels and insulin resistance. PCOS seems to have a connection
              with family history and genetics. Hence, it runs in families due
              to mutation in one or more genes. It increases the risk for the
              family to develop the same metabolic abnormality. How does
              Inflammation Cause PCOS? Inflammation occurs when your body’s
              natural immune system reacts to a foreign substance in an attempt
              to protect your body from an invader. Unfortunately, sometimes
              this response is triggered to react to your cells. Without going
              all science-y, there is a high correlation between PCOS and
              inflammation markers such as oxidative stress, inflammatory
              cytokines, white blood cells (lymphocytes and monocytes).
              Inflammation makes it harder to lose weight and is associated with
              diabetes, insulin resistance and heart disease (common in those
              with PCOS). How does Lifestyle Cause PCOS? Leading an unhealthy
              lifestyle increases the risk of PCOS. Poor eating habits, lack of
              physical activity, gaining too much weight, sleeping disorders,
              and high-stress levels are the substantial causes of PCOS. It also
              leads to physically and emotionally distressing symptoms. A diet
              high in carbohydrates can cause insulin resistance in your body.
              It can cause low-grade inflammation, which stimulates the
              androgens' production and cysts' creation in your ovaries. It can
              also lead to cardiovascular problems. Check out Lori app and get
              your personalized nutrition plan today. To manage a healthy
              lifestyle, it recommends a healthy eating regime without any
              artificial supplementation. Lack of physical activity is a
              potential contributing factor to insulin resistance. It leads to a
              higher concentration of estrogen in the body which causes weight
              gain. Higher than a healthy weight worsens insulin resistance and,
              it increases the production of male hormones responsible for PCOS
              symptoms. Depression and other mental health disorders can worsen
              your PCOS symptoms. It causes reproductive dysfunctions in your
              body (e.g., infertility). Lack of quality sleep is associated with
              an increased risk of obesity, fatigue, increased hunger, and
              insulin resistance. The causes for PCOS/PCOD may be many but there
              is a one-step solution for all this. This is where Lori app helps
              you. It creates your personalized health plan based on your body’s
              requirement. It can assess the root cause of your disorder

              fatigue. Weight reduction leads to a decrease in glucose
              intolerance, which, in turn, leads to improvement in reproductive
              and metabolic derangements in PCOS. Exercise training improves the
              regularity of menstrual cycles and ovulation. Focus on your
              physical activity, frequency, duration, and intensity and make
              sure not to overdo it. Include exercise in your daily routine, and
              you'll see that your hormone balance is restored naturally. [READ

              PCOS/PCOD? Women with PCOS are more likely to possess reduced
              quality of life and anxiety and/or depression symptoms. If you are
              constantly under pressure, it disrupts the hormonal/endocrine
              system. Avoiding stress is very important to ensure your hormonal
              balance. Elevated levels of stress for long periods can be harmful
              to your hormones and overall health. Hence you should practice
              meditation, yoga or mindfulness to ensure that you stay more in
              the present. [READ MORE: PCOS AND MENTAL HEALTH: HOW TO HANDLE
              STRESS AND ANXIETY?] Is PCOS/PCOD disturbing your Sleep? Your body
              requires at least 7-9 hrs of sleep to function normally. Make sure
              you get quality sleep every day to ensure hormonal balance. Sleep
              deprivation leads to increased hunger and carbs craving. Leptin or
              satiety hormone is suppressed due to lack of sleep. This is why
              you feel hunger pangs on the day that you have not slept well.
              Regulating sleep helps you achieve good results in the reversal of
              PCOS. Fix your sleep issues by focusing on sleep hygiene. If you
              are experiencing sleep disturbances, it will most likely be taken
              care of by the diet and lifestyle adjustments. Fortunately, you'll
              reverse PCOS with the proper combination of diet, exercise, sleep,
              and meditation. Put conscious efforts to correct your condition.
              Consult with your physician if you have any specific needs. [READ

                Disease (PCOD) interchangeably, but they actually are not the

              Are PCOS and PCOD the Same We use Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
              and Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOD) interchangeably, but they
              actually are not the same. Both are gynaecological problems
              associated with your ovaries and have similar causes, but they are
              different. But there are many differences between the two that you
              simply must know! Before we go into the sciencey explanation, here
              is a little example. The Endocrine system is made up of glands
              that make hormones. So if hormones are cars, Endocrine System is
              the factory that they are made in. PCOD is a hormonal disorder
              (From our example, it is the issue with cars. e.g. brakes, engine
              etc.). PCOD is considered temporary as there are higher
              possibilities to reverse it (You can go to a repair shop and get
              the car fixed). PCOD is more common as compared to PCOS. The
              ovaries contain many immature or partially mature eggs, which
              eventually become a cyst. These cysts cause more cysts, and so the
              cycle goes. It does not cause infertility in all women, and with
              medical intervention, the women can conceive successfully. Women
              who have PCOD may have similar symptoms as PCOS, but they ovulate
              periodically. PCOD can be fixed with lifestyle changes. PCOS is an
              endocrinological disorder (From our example, it is an issue with
              the factory. e.g. assembly line issues). PCOS is severe (needs a
              lot more work to fix this) and has serious complications. In PCOS,
              the ovaries produce higher levels of androgen, which interferes
              with egg development and release. A number of the eggs become
              cysts. These cysts build up within the ovaries and may even get
              enlarged during ovulation. For women with PCOS, conception can
              become a bit of a challenge. They even have higher rates of
              miscarriages. PCOS needs more medical intervention and clinical
              supervision. [READ MORE: WHAT IS PCOS?] What are the Causes of
              PCOS and PCOD? Though the exact cause is unknown, a lot of factors
              contribute to both these conditions. PCOD • Poor eating habits •
              Lack of physical activity • Stress • Gaining too much weight •
              Excess production of insulin PCOS • High-Stress Level • Hormonal
              imbalance • Metabolic disorder • Heredity • Excess production of

              MORE: WHAT IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF PCOS?] How to Diagnose PCOS and
              PCOD? There is no specific test to diagnose PCOS or PCOD and,
              there aren't any universal diagnostic criteria. this is often
              because the signs and symptoms for both are quite common. A doctor
              would recommend several tests to diagnose a PCOS/PCOD condition.
              These tests include physical examination, blood tests, ultrasound,
              and pelvic scans. Pelvic/Transvaginal/Abdomen ultrasound: This
              ultrasound is the testing process to create an image of the
              ovaries to detect the cysts. In PCOS, the ovaries could also be
              larger than the usual size and characteristically have 12 or more
              follicles per ovary. In PCOD, the ovaries might not appear large
              but have follicles (5 to 6 per ovary) that can be relatively
              smaller and immature. Often the cysts are lined alongside the
              surface of the ovaries. Physical Examination: Your doctor may
              conduct a physical examination where he/she may measure your
              weight, calculate your BMI, observe abnormal hair growth, hair
              loss, increase in acne, etc. Pelvic Examination: The doctor may
              conduct a physical examination, where he/she may feel any abnormal
              growth within the pelvic area. It is to detect abnormalities
              within the ovaries, clitoris, vagina, fallopian tubes, rectum,
              cervix etc. Blood Tests: TSH, T3, and T4: The most common test
              assigned to the physical symptoms could be a thyroid test. The
              TSH, T3, and T4 blood tests calculate the extent of thyroid
              hormones in your bloodstream. Hormone Tests (FSH, LH,
              Testosterone, Oestrogen, Androgen): Follicle Stimulating Hormone
              (FSH) regulates your ability to get pregnant, while LH (LH)
              promotes your ovulation. If you've got PCOS, FSH would be less
              than the normal level while LH would be higher. [READ MORE: I

              PCOS DURING PREGNANCY-WHAT ARE THE PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS WITH

              problems or complications during pregnancy. Complications of
              pregnancy commonly associated with PCOS can even affect the
              infant. PCOS can increase your risk of some complications during
              pregnancy, such as: • Miscarriage • Gestational diabetes •
              Preeclampsia • High blood pressure induced by the pregnancy
              Miscarriage or an early loss of pregnancy If you have PCOS, you
              are more likely to miscarry in the early months of pregnancy,
              though the cause for this relationship is unclear. Researchers
              believe that a few factors may be to blame. If you tend to have
              longer menstrual cycles, meaning that ovulation occurs later on.
              This exposes the developing egg to lots of hormones, possibly
              damaging it. There is also a known relationship between
              uncontrolled blood sugar and miscarriage. Given that if you tend
              to have insulin resistance and elevated insulin levels, that may
              contribute to poor egg quality and miscarriage. Problems with
              implantation such as high androgen level and endometrium
              dysfunction, may also play a role in the increased risk of early
              pregnancy loss. Gestational diabetes This is a type of diabetes
              that only pregnant women get. It is treatable and does not cause
              significant problems. In most cases, the condition goes away after
              pregnancy. If you have gestational diabetes your baby is at high
              risk for high birth weight, preterm birth, low blood sugar,
              jaundice, and have trouble breathing. Preeclampsia It is a sudden
              increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy that
              can affect your kidneys, liver, and brain. If left untreated,
              preeclampsia can turn into eclampsia. Eclampsia can cause organ
              damage, seizures, and even death. Pregnancy-induced high blood
              pressure This condition is due to an increase in blood pressure
              that may occur in the second half of pregnancy. If not treated, it
              can lead to preeclampsia. This type of high blood pressure can
              also affect the delivery of the baby. [ READ MORE: CAN PCOS BECOME

              of lifestyle changes or medication if necessary. It's important to
              monitor your blood sugar as directed by your physician. The
              primary treatment for the condition is to deliver the baby, even
              preterm if necessary. It is important to watch out for signs and
              symptoms of preeclampsia and promptly report them to your doctor.

              PCOS and tracking your periods: Does that help? YES, It does!
              Tracking your periods can help you a lot and be that one friend
              that never lets you down! PCOS/PCOD is a hormonal imbalance
              disorder that predominantly attacks your ovaries and creates
              complications in your menstruation and ovulation process.
              Therefore, tracking your periods can help you detect PCOS and also
              help in keeping tabs on your PCOS symptoms. [READ MORE: WHAT ARE
              THE SYMPTOMS OF PCOS?] Can you detect PCOS by tracking periods?
              When you have PCOS/PCOD, your body will have higher male hormone
              levels in your ovaries and it will create small cysts in the
              entrance of your ovaries to block the release of your eggs. This
              will cause a lot of irregularities in your menstrual cycle.
              Therefore, by tracking your periods you can detect PCOS symptoms
              early on and find ways to reverse your PCOS. It is vital for you
              to detect PCOS at an earlier stage because, at a later stage, it
              can lead to serious health conditions such as Endometrial/Uterine
              cancer and Cardiovascular diseases. [READ MORE: CAN PCOS BECOME
              WORSE?] What does PCOS period tracking mean? PCOS can be initially
              detected through its major symptom, the irregularity in the
              menstrual cycle. This irregularity varies from women to women so
              merely marking your periods on a calendar will do you no good. You
              need to observe your menstrual cycle for over a year and calculate
              the no of days between each menstruation in order to figure out if
              you really have irregularities in your periods because of PCOS.
              The average duration between each menstruation is 28 days but
              anything between 21 and 35 days is also considered to be in the
              normal range so along with this, tracking your periods for a
              longer time is also necessary. Some of the commonly experienced
              irregularities faced by women with PCOS are: • Delay in getting
              the first periods in Adolescents. • Having less than 8 periods in
              a year • Having no periods for 2-3 consecutive months • Excessive
              bleeding ( more than 80 ml blood) along with painful cramps in the
              pelvic region. • Periods lasting for less than 2 days or lasting
              more than 5 days. [READ MORE: WHAT DOES YOUR PERIOD TELL YOU ABOUT
              PCOS?] How does tracking periods help after diagnosing PCOS?
              Women, who are diagnosed with PCOS, commonly worry about their
              fertility since PCOS affects the quality of the eggs produced in
              ovaries, which leads to infertility and multiple miscarriages.
              Once you are diagnosed with PCOS and start your reversal of PCOS
              process, your periods will start to get back on track But you
              still need to continue tracking your periods to get familiar with
              your body’s fertility period. Usually, the time frame between your
              ovulation (release of egg from ovary) and your period starting is
              6 days so the five days in between is best to try conceiving.
              Since your PCOS will still continue to have some effect on your
              periods, tracking your periods regularly will help you figure out
              the pattern in your periods and determine that 5-day window that’s
              best to get pregnant. [READ MORE: WHAT ARE THE PREGNANCY
              COMPLICATIONS WITH PCOS?] Even if you are not trying to get
              pregnant, tracking your periods can be of great help. You can use
              your period info to determine if your current treatment towards
              the reversal of PCOS is effective and help you track the
              improvement of your PCOS symptoms. Having definite evidence of
              your periods getting regular can help raise your spirits and
