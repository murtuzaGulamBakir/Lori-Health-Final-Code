            another. It is hard to provide a specific time when the reversal
            will happen. You can use the Lori app as long as you would like

          <p class="answer">
            We offer a wide range of cuisines and varieties that you can choose
            from. The dishes are easy to prepare and are tailored to your health
            needs. Crash diets are a concept that we don’t believe in. Rest
            assured your food suggestions are based on your lifestyle, food
            preferences, clinical concerns, allergies, and any other inputs such
            as DNA, that you have given us. The nutrition regime provides you
            with suggestions that you can easily make at home and make you feel
            well-fed. We have designed each of the dishes to provide you with
            the right kind of nutrition, both macronutrients (carbohydrates,
            proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

            Every suggestion comes with almost 9 alternate options for you to

          <p class="answer">
            Weight is not an issue but is a symptom of an underlying one. Lori
            promotes a healthy lifestyle, part of which is to help you manage
            your weight. The nutrition regime helps you healthily manage your

            weight and become healthy, but you become healthy and lose weight in
            the process. The funda is that once you start a health regime, your
            weight will be certainly under control. Cause and effect, my friend!

          <p class="answer">
            Yes, it is. We have helped several thousand women with PCOS in
            various ways. PCOS can be reversed by improving your insulin
            sensitivity and your metabolism, which in turn would lead to a
            reduction in weight and will help you achieve a normal menstrual
            cycle. The right combination of diet, exercise and sleep will get
            you to the finish line. <br /><br />
            However, please do note that this isn’t a cure but a remission.
            Certain lifestyle changes can bring back the symptoms.

          <p class="answer">
            Yes, of course. We have helped several thousand individuals with
            Diabetes in various ways. Diabetes can be reversed by improving your
            insulin sensitivity and your metabolism, which in turn would lead to
            a reduction in weight and will help you achieve a normal blood sugar
            level and HbA1c levels. The right combination of diet and exercise
            will get you to the finish line.

          <h3>Why is my period late?</h3>

          <p class="answer">
            An average menstrual cycle is 24 days, i.e., it takes about 24 days
            for your period to start, from the date of your last period. This
            cycle length, in reality, varies from 21 – 40 days.
            <br />
            <br />
            A period is officially considered late if it is more than 6 weeks
            since your last period. A period can be late because of multiple
            reasons other than pregnancy. Stress, weight fluctuations, obesity,
            thyroid issues, clinical conditions such as PCOS, birth control,
            chronic diseases like diabetes can throw off your menstrual cycle.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are around 40 years of age, you can also miss periods due to
            an early perimenopause. Most women begin menopause between ages 45
            to 55.

            Yes. We offer a cardiometabolic risk check that gives you a snapshot

            The genetic test is to know your genetic predisposition of the

            diseases. The aim of this test is to provide you with all the
            information about future disease risks, for you to act today. Please
            do note that the ‘future risk’ does not in any way indicate the
            occurrence of disease for sure. It is only a potential risk.

          <h3>What can my DNA tell me about myself?</h3>

          <p class="answer">
            Oh, yes curious soul, we love your curiosity! DNA testing or
            nutrigenetic testing, as it is scientifically called, analyses the
            response of our DNA markers to the various nutrients. Combined with
            nutrigenomics, it also helps you understand how different foods may
            interact with specific genes to increase the risk of common chronic
            diseases such as type-2 diabetes, obesity, stroke, and certain
            cancers. <br />
            <br />
            Our DNA test panel is extensive and covers a multitude of health
            factors – nutrition, fitness, immunity, cardio-metabolic risk, skin
            health and certain cancers. Although the DNA test can provide
            important information for diagnosing, it doesn’t really reflect the
            current state of your body. Results in some cases can be
            inconclusive and in some, testing might cause stress and anxiety.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please be assured that the DNA test is another layer of information
            that we use to personalize the health solution for you and is in no
            way a mandatory requirement.

            - Drink plenty of water during your fasting cycle. You can also have
            an herbal tea or black coffee, without any sweeteners. <br />
            <br />
            - When you break your fast, make sure you eat a good portion of
            vegetables. Do not consume fatty foods as they may cause you
            digestive issues. <br />
            <br />
            - Make sure to include all food groups (unless you are allergic to
            any) in your food to ensure that you consume the vitamins and
            minerals that your body needs.

            undergoes while fasting. Click “start the fast” when you are ready
            to start the fast after you have finished eating a meal. Because you
            have selected a fasting cycle already, we will notify you when your
            fast is coming to an end. Also, the tracker provides you with
            information on what is happening in your body while you are fasting.
            The history graphs show you the fasting history and the number of
            times that you have achieved the goal that you have set for
            yourself. Do watch out for more updates to help your fasting
            experience become better. Write to us at

            suggestions or feedback.

          <p class="answer">
            While breastfeeding, you would require additional calories not fewer
            to support the milk production. We do not advise breastfeeding
            mothers to do an intermittent fasting regime.

          <p class="answer">
            While you are fasting, you should drink plenty of water to make sure
            you are not dehydrated. You can also have herbal teas (e.g., green
            tea) or a black coffee (without any sweetener or sugar). Do not
            consume any sweeteners or their substitutes and zero calorie drinks.

          <h3>How do I choose a fasting cycle?</h3>

          <p class="answer">
            On the fasting tracker, you can see a dropdown to select a fasting
            cycle. You can use the below guide to select the one that suits you.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you a newbie, start slowly, with a 12-14 hour fast. This fast is
            relatively easy to follow as you probably are doing it without
            realising it – e.g. If you take your dinner at 8PM and the next day
            breakfast at 8AM, this indicates a 12 hour fast, if you don’t
            consume anything else in this window. This cycle will help with
            general detox and shows steady progress over time. You can do this
            all your life, without any issues. <br />
            <br />
            If you are familiar with fasting, you can choose a 16-18 hour fast.
            You can manage this with a little effort. Think of a regime where
            you eat a dinner at 8pm and the next meal at 12pm the next day.
            Because of the longer fast cycle, this fast has more benefits.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are already an expert, go ahead with a 20+ hour fast to push
            yourself a bit further. Because your gut rests for an extended
            period of time, it makes you feel more energetic and focused.
            Despite the many benefits, we don’t recommend you do this every day.
            <br />
            <br />
            Bottomline, giving your gut rest leads to many health benefits!

          <p class="answer">
            Intermittent Fasting is suitable for adults, based on scientific
            research. It is not advisable for those in periods of rapid growth,
            such as children and adolescents.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, intermittent fasting is not
            advisable for you. <br />
            <br />
            Anyone with a chronic disease or elderly shouldn’t commence
            intermittent fasting without guidance. If you have an existing
            clinical concern, please consult with your physician to understand
            the risks of intermittent fasting, should you have any

          <h3>What is intermittent fasting? How does it work?</h3>

          <p class="answer">
            Intermittent fasting is not a diet but is a method of eating. It
            falls in the concept of “not only what you eat is important, but
            also when you eat is!”. The fasting method helps body undergo
            various processes and help with efficient breakdown of stored fats.
            The method is scientifically proven and has tons of research
            attached to it.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can start as a beginner with the basic fast cycle. The fasting
            tracker reminds you and keeps you posted as to when to start and end
            the fast and what is happening with your body while you fast! And
            your health plan is altered to accommodate your fasting cycle, so
            you know what you should eat when you stop the fast.
